1.0 PROJECT IDENTIFICATION 

Project Name: INFT3000 Capstone - SB-GARD Suiteâ„¢ 

Description: 

Multiple PowerShell security tools that enable user-friendly intrusion detection notifications and reports. These tools are to support better awareness of potential inconsistencies within a network and allow for greater transparency on events recorded on a given network/machine. 

Background: 

Six cybersecurity students, leveraging their learned skillset to create a year-end project for Capstone to prepare and deliver documentations, presentations and a final product using a variety of platforms. 

A suite of security tools will be developed with intent for them to be used by security analysts that could benefit from additional monitoring and notifications of changes in their environment. Prerequisites for the project will include knowledge in PowerShell scripting, project management skills, and database development knowledge. 

The tools will be developed for the Windows OS platform. Pseudocode will be written initially for the suite of services with plans to iterate on as the project moves forward and expectedly changes. We will design a website where we can share our features and our story with the public.
