Background: 

Six cybersecurity students, leveraging their learned skillset to create a year-end project for Capstone to prepare and deliver documentations, presentations and a final product using a variety of platforms. 

 

A suite of security tools will be developed with intent for them to be used by security analysts that could benefit from additional monitoring and notifications of changes in their environment. Prerequisites for the project will include knowledge in PowerShell scripting, project management skills, and database development knowledge. 

 

The tools will be developed for the Windows OS platform. Pseudocode will be written initially for the suite of services with plans to iterate on as the project moves forward and expectedly changes. We will design a website where we can share our features and our story with the public. 

PROJECT OBJECTIVES 

To provide a user-friendly professional suite of cybersecurity tools that will aid security analysts with potential endpoint intrusions by providing notifications. 

To provide a method of temporarily privileged account use for admins to access the endpoint/network and carry out their duties. 

Develop a service that matches PIDs with service name 

Develop a service to help catch suspicious logons from a new and/or unauthorized logon 

Develop a service to help catch changes made to the routing table and/or host file 

Develop a service that catches suspicious logons from authorized users 

Build a website that presents our product and team 

The scope of the project DOES NOT include: 

Package the software into a product that will be sold to third parties 

Deploying developed solutions in a production environment 

Marketing for our product
